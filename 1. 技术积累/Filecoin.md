# Filecoin

## 1.Introduction

a protocal      

novel proof : ***Proof-of-spacetime***        blocks store data

provide a data **storage** and **retrieval** service

1. pay to use
2. **Storage Miners** earn tokens by offering storage
3. **Retrieval Miners** earn tokens by serving data



### 1.1 Elementary Components

- **Decentralized Storage Network (**DSN**)**   Sec2 Sec4
- **Novel** **Proofs-of-Storage**  
  1. ***Proof-of-Replication***  prove providers replicate the data physically
  2. ***Proof-of-spacetime***  prove providers have stored data for some time
- **Verifiable Markets**
  - two orders 订单
    - storage requests
    - retrieval requests
- **Useful** **Proof-of-Work**
  - construct it based on *Proof-of-Spacetime* to avoid wasteful computation

### 1.2 Protocal Overview

- Filecoin protocal is a DSN
- verifiable markets handle requests as orders
- markets employ **Novel** **Proofs-of-Storage** 
- PoS by the amount of their storage
